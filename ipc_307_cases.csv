RESPONDENT:
STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH

DATE OF JUDGMENT21/10/1971

BENCH:


ACT:Indian	Penal Code, ss. 96 to 106--Scope--Right	 of  Private
defence--Exercise of the right when justified.



HEADNOTE:
The,  inhabitants  of village S who were  all  Muslims	were
divided	 into two groups.  The relations between  them	were
very  much  strained  :	 so much  so  that  one	 group	felt
compelled to leave that village and shift to a new site	 for
residence  where they formed a new village called  NS.	 The
old village S was thereafter called JS.	 Differences between
the  two  groups,  however,  remained  unresolved  and	 the
bitterness  did	 not abate.  On the day of Id  in  February,
1965  residents	 of both the above villages went  to  Sanwar
Mosque	for  offering  prayers.	 The  people  from  the	 old
village	 (JS) had to pass through the new village  (NS)	 for
going to the Mosque.  After the prayers when the inhabitants
of  JS were returning to their village they were  confronted
by  armed  inhabitants	of  NS at  the	outskirts  of  their
village.  There were attacks and counterattacks between	 the
rival  groups  belonging to the two  villages  resulting  in
casualties  and	 also injuries to several  persons  on	both
sides.	 This  occurrence gave rise to two  cross-cases	 and
both  groups were separately tried by the same	Judge.	 The
prosecution succeeded in securing conviction of some accused
persons in both the cases.  The plea of the right of private
defence raised by both sides was rejected.
On  appeal in the High Court both sides repeated their	plea
of self defence which was negatived.
On appeal by special leave.
HELD  :	 (i)  the people of village JS had a  right  to	 for
prayers to Sanwar Mosque on the day of Id and merely because
the  only route to the Mosque passed through village NS	 the
inhabitants of which were inimical towards them, they  could
not be deprived of the right to use that route.	 When in the
lawful and bonafide ..."

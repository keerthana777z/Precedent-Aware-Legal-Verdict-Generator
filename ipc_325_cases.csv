ACT:Indian Penal Code(45 of 1860), ss. 302 and 34-Acquittal  of
one of two accused-No evidence regarding injuries caused  by
the other to deceased-Nature of offence committed by him.



HEADNOTE:
Two  accused were charged with an offence unders. 302read
withs. 34I.P.C. The victim had four lathi injuries on	 his
head-two  fatal	 and  two simple.  One of  the	accused	 was
acquitted.   On	 the  question whether the  other  could  be
convicted  for an offence unders. 302simpliciter  without
establishing  that he had caused at least one of  the  major
injuries,
HELD  :	 As  a result of the acquittal of  one	of  the	 two
accused,  the  common intention was not proved.	 In  such  a
case it could not be postulated that the other accused alone
caused	all  the  four injuries	 and  the  prosecution	must
establish  the exact nature of the injury caused by  him  In
the  absence of such evidence, he must be given the  benefit
of  doubt with respect to the offence unders. 302, but	 may
be convicted for the offence of causing grevious hurt  unders. 325[453 H; 454 A-D, C]

intention-Evidence showing  only intention to cause grievous
hurt-Victim dying but no evidence as to. who caused the only
fatal injury-If accused could be convicted underss. 302and34.



HEADNOTE:
     Nine accused  were charged	 with offences of murder and
causing hurt.  The trial  Court acquitted  two and convicted
the others  underss.  325and147, I.P.C. on appeal by the
State, the  High Court	convicted the  two  appellants	also
unders. 302read with 8. 34.I.P.C.
     Partly allowing their appeal to this Court,
^
     HELD: The	High Court has not examined the liability of
the accused  with due  regard to the facts and circumstances
of the	case. Instead  of giving  a categorical finding, the
High Court  stated at  one place  in its-  judgment that the
appellants must	 be taken to have had the knowledge that the
injury which  they intended  to	 cause	to  the	 victim	 was
""likely to result"" in his death, and in an other place, that
the appellant  were guilty  of	an  offence  under  s.	300,
fourthly, because  they ""ought	to have known that their act
was so	imminently dangerous  having regard  to the  age and
condition  of	the  victim  that  their  act  must  in	 all
probability cause  death or  such bodily injury as is likely
to cause  death."" But  the evidence on record shows that the
appellants did	not have  the common  intention of  giving a
beating to the deceased when they reached his house but were
only bent  upon settling  scores with  his son.	 It was only
when the  deceased asked  another witness  to  get  ready  a
bullock cart for making a complaint about the beating of his
son that the appellants inflicted injuries on him. But there
was nothing  to show that their in..."

accidental  or	unintentional and was  sufficient  to  cause
death  in the ordinary (course of nature--Indian Penal	Code(Act XLII of 1860), s. 300, 3rdly.



HEADNOTE:
The accused thrust a spear into the abdomen of ,he deceased.
This injury caused his death.  In the opinion of the  doctor
the  injury  was sufficient to cause death in  the  ordinary
course	of nature.  It was found by the Sessions judge	that
the  accused intended to cause grievous hurt only.   In	 his
opinion however the third clause OfS. 300Indian Penal Code
applied.  He accordingly convicted and sentenced the accused
underS. 302India, Penal Code.  The High Court upheld	 the
conviction,  It was argued that the third clause Of  s.	 300Indian	Penal Codedid not apply as it was not	proved	that
the accused intended to inflict a

bodily	injury	that was sufficient to cause  death  in	 the
ordinary course of nature ass. 300Indian Penal Code  third
clause states, "" If it is done with the intention of causing

Penal Code-s. 300, Thirdly-scope of



HEADNOTE:
When  the deceased declined to marry him the  appellant	 who
was  her paramour, threatened to kill her in a	manner	that
she would have a lingering death.  He carried out the threat
by  pouring acid over her when she was lying on a cot.	 The
deceased  who  had sustained extensive acid burns  over	 her
body  died a few days later.  The trial court convicted	 him
under  a. 302I.P.C. and sentenced him to  imprisonment	 for
life.  The High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence.
On  appeal  it	was  contended that  the  intention  of	 the
appellant was not to kill the deceased but only to disfigure
her and, therefore, the offence would fall unders.    304part  I	 or under a. 326I.P.C. and that death	was  due  to
negligence.
Dismissing the appeal,
HELD: The appellant is guilty of offence punishable unders.
302I.P.C. [525B]
(1)  To	 bring a case under cl. 3 ofs. 300the	 prosecution
must  establish : (i) bodily injury (ii) the nature  of	 the
injury	(iii)  intention to inflict that  particular  bodily
injury and (iv) that it is sufficient to cause death in	 the
ordinary  course  of nature.  Once these four  elements	 are
established  by the prosecution the offence is murder  unders.  300cl. 3I.P.C.; it does not matter that there  was  no
intention to cause death.  It does not matter that there was
no  intention  even  to cause an injury of a  kind  that  is
sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of  nature.
[522E-H]
In the present case it is established beyond doubt that	 the
accused intended to cause injuries by throwing acid and	 the
injuries were actually caused on the person of the deceased.

HEADNOTE:
    The	 appellant  was tried for an offence  under  s.	 302I.P.C.	as well as for other offences in connection with  an
incident  in  which  two persons  were	killed	and  several
injured.   The allegation against the appellant was that  he
caused the death of one K by shooting him with a gun in	 the
course	of  the alleged incident.  The	Additional  Sessions
Judge  who  tried  the	case  convicted	 the  appellant	 for
offences under ss. 326/149. 324/34, 201 'and 148I.P.C.	 but
acquitted him in respect of the murder of K. In so doing  he
relied	upon  an attested copy filed by	 the  defence  which
purported to be the copy of an entry in the Chaukidar's hath
chitha	according  to  which K died three  days	 before	 the
alleged incident.  He also relied on the fact that the	name
of 'K was not mentioned as a victim in the First Information
Report of the incident.	 In appeal the High Court  convicted
the  appellant unders. 304I.P.C. for causing the death  of
K,  holding  that the alleged entry in the hath	 chitha	 had
been  wrongly  admitted in evidence by the trial  judge	 and
that   the  deficiency	in  the	 F.I.R.	  was	sufficiently
explained.   Appeal  against the High Court's  judgment	 was
filed by special leave.
    HELD:  (i)	The attested copy of  the  Chaukidar's	hath
chitha	was not admissible in evidence because the entry  in
question  was  not  proved to have been	 ma..."

HEADNOTE:
     The  appellant,  who was in military service,  his	 two
brothers  and two others were charged with the	offences  of
criminal  trespass,  murdering the Sarpanch of	the  Village
Panchayat  and causing grevious hurts to PW2. Two  more	 ac-
cused  were charged for having burnt the wheat	bundles	 be-
longing	 to  the  deceased. The Trial  Court  acquitted	 the
appellant  and two others extending to them  the benefit  of
doubt.	Appellant's two brothers were convicted for offences
underSections 149,302/34IPC and 326/34IPC. The remaining
two accused were convicted for an offence undersection	 435IPC.
     On	 appeal,  the High Court acquitted the	two  accused
convicted underSection 435IPC and convicted the  appellant
and his two brothers for offences undersections 449,302/34IPC and 326/34IPC. The appellant has preferred the present
appeal,	  against  his	conviction  and	 sentence  of	life
imprisonment as also the fine imposed on him.
     The appellant contended that he was falsely  implicated
in  the case; that there was confusion about  the  names  of
the accused; that he left the village in the evening at 4.00
p.m.  prior to the alleged commission of offence which	took
place  at about 10.30 p.m. in the night. Thus the  appellant
set  up	 a plea of alibi, stating that he left	the  village
much prior to the alleged offence in order to join his	unit
in the Military	 he was serving.

ACT:Indian Penal  Code1860-S.	 149-Conviction under  clear
finding regarding common object of assembly-Necessity of.



HEADNOTE:
     When the  appellants wanted  to irrigate  the land they
were prevented	from doing so by the deceased as a result of
which the 1st appellant who is now dead gave a bhala blow to
the deceased.  The other  appellants were  supposed to	have
been armed  with lathis	 but they did not cause any injuries
either to the witnesses or to the deceased.
     The Sessions  Judge convicted  the 1st  appellant undersection 304Part I  of theIndian Penal Codeand sentenced
him  to	  undergo  imprisonment	  for  life  and  the  other
appellants undersection 326/149of the  Indian Penal Code
and sentenced them to undergo 3 years' rigorous imprisonment
but affirmed  the acquittal  of the individual charges undersections 323and325I.P.C. The High Court while convicting
the appellant undersections 325/149of the I.P.C. has given
no finding  regarding the  common  object  of  the  unlawful
assembly.
     Accepting the appeal, the Court
^
     HELD:  In	the  instant  case,  there  is	neither	 any
evidence nor  any finding  that any  of the  ingredients  ofsection 149have been	established by the prosecution. Even
on the	prosecution case itself the occurrence took place as
a result  of an	 irrigation dispute  and the appellants were
merely acting  under a	bona fide  claim or belief that they
had the	 right to  irrigate the	 land. There is no overt act
attributed to  any  of	the  appellants	 in  regard  to	 the
deceased and  the mere	fact that  the appellants were armed
with lathis  by itself	would not prove that they shared the
common object  with which the deceased was inspired. [292..."

 CITATOR INFO :
 R	    1988 SC 863	 (11)


ACT:Indian	Penal Code,S. 34vis-a-vis s. 38-Assault by  common
intention  to  cause  injury  likely  to  result  in  death-
Development   of   further  common  intention	among	some
assailants  to	commit murder-Liability for  murder  whether
shared by all participants unders. 34.



HEADNOTE:
The  three appellants assaulted deceased Shashi	 Mohan	with
the common intention to cause injury likely to result in his
death,	but  during  the assault, two of  them	developed  a
further	 common	 intention of murdering him.   The  sessions
Court tried the appellants for charges u/ss. 302/34 and	 ss.
323  /34I.P.C.  but  giving them  the	 benefit  of  doubt,
acquitted them.	 In a State appeal, the High Court set aside
the  acquittal	order,	and  convicted	all  the  assailants
sentencing them for life.
This Court considered the question whether the conviction of
all  the three appellantsu/s. 302with aid ofs. 34I.P.C.
was justified in law, and partly allowing only the appeal of
Bhaba Nanda Sarma.
HELD  :-Applying  the principle of law unders.	 38of	 the
Penal  Code, the case of Bhaba Nanda can be  separated	from
that of his two brothers.  He shared their common  intention
to assault, with the knowledge that it was likely to  result
in death but while committing the act in furtherance of that
common	intention,  the other two developed and	 shared	 the
common	intention of causing the murder.  Bhaba	 Nanda	can,
therefore,  be held guilty onlyu/s. 304Part 11  while	 the
other two appellants are liable for the murder with the	 aid
ofs. 34of the Penal Code. [717 G-H, 718 A-B]

ACT:
Criminal  Trial--Culpable  homicide  amounting	to  murder--
Prosecution   to   Prove-Presence  and	Nature	 of   Injury
-Intention  to cause that Particular Injury, which  was	 not
accidental  or	unintentional and was  sufficient  to  cause
death  in the ordinary (course of nature--Indian Penal	Code(Act XLII of 1860), s. 300, 3rdly.



HEADNOTE:
The accused thrust a spear into the abdomen of ,he deceased.
This injury caused his death.  In the opinion of the  doctor
the  injury  was sufficient to cause death in  the  ordinary
course	of nature.  It was found by the Sessions judge	that
the  accused intended to cause grievous hurt only.   In	 his
opinion however the third clause OfS. 300Indian Penal Code
applied.  He accordingly convicted and sentenced the accused
underS. 302India, Penal Code.  The High Court upheld	 the
conviction,  It was argued that the third clause Of  s.	 300Indian	Penal Codedid not apply as it was not	proved	that
the accused intended to inflict a
1496
bodily	injury	that was sufficient to cause  death  in	 the
ordinary course of nature ass. 300Indian Penal Code  third
clause states, "" If it is done with the intention of causing
bodily	injury to any person and the bodily injury  intended
to  be	inflicted is sufficient in the	ordinary  course  of
nature to cause death

it  can	 bring a case unders. 300Indian Penal	 Code  third
clause.
(1)  It	 must establish, quite objectively,  that  a  bodily
injury is present.
(2)  The  nature  of the injury must be	 proved;  these	 are

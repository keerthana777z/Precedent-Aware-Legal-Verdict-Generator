 B.K. Mullick, Acting C.J.
 

1. This case comes before us on a reference underSection 374of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the Sessions Judge of Muzaffarpur and also on appeal by the prisoner Lalji Dusadh alias Lalji Mallah.
 

2. The appellant is alleged to have robbed and killed a young man named Abdul about 8 P.M. on the 9th November, 1926. For the robbery he was charged underSections 392and397of the Indian Penal Code and tried by a Jury of five. For the offence of murder he was charged underSection 302of the Indian Penal Code and tried by the Sessions Judge with the help of the above Jurors sitting as Assessors.
 

3. The unanimous verdict of the Jurors in the trial for the offences underSections 392and397was that the appellant was guilty. The opinion of the Assessors on the charge of murder was to the same effect.
 

4. The learned Sessions Judge, agreeing with the Assessors, has sentenced the appellant to death for the offence of murder. Agreeing with the Jurors he has also found the appellant guilty of the offences underSections 392and397but he has passed no separate sentence.
 

5. The appellant is thirty years of age. His home was in Mauza Mushari in the District of Muzaffarpur and he belonged by birth to the Mallah caste. About two years before the murder he was outcasted in consequence of an intrigue with a Dusadh woman named Kanchania who lived in Mauza Madhopur in the same District and he became a Dusadh. He lived with her for two or three months in Madhopur and then emigrated to the District of Dinaj pur taking her with him and one infant child. Later his mother joined him with his other child and thereafter for 5 or 6 months in 1926 he worked as a labourer in the service of one Anjor Sahai in Mauza Nashipur is the District of Dinajpur.
 

6. The deceased Abdul was twenty-five at the time of his death. He came to Dinajpur when he was quite a child and worked there for about twenty years. He was a Goala by caste and the name given to him..."

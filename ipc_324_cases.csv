ceased	is  stated to have received fatal  blows  by  lethal
weapons whilst his daughter (PW 1), sleeping nearby received

Packaging Company, Proddotur and Transport Workers,  espous-
ing  the cause of workmen and directing their union  activi-

the managements of these companies and tendered legal advice
to  them  in  connection with the  various  labour  problems
arising	 in those companies. The deceased who was  a  lawyer
for  the  companies  had advised the accused No.  1  not  to
resort	to violence for settlement of  industrial  disputes.

which the deceased agreed to provide to PW 11 for setting up
an  office of INTUC in his own office. This was intended  to
counter	 the  militant activities of Accused 1	who  was  in

HEADNOTE:
The accused thrust a spear into the abdomen of ,he deceased.
This injury caused his death.  In the opinion of the  doctor
the  injury  was sufficient to cause death in  the  ordinary
course	of nature.  It was found by the Sessions judge	that
the  accused intended to cause grievous hurt only.   In	 his
opinion however the third clause OfS. 300Indian Penal Code
applied.  He accordingly convicted and sentenced the accused
underS. 302India, Penal Code.  The High Court upheld	 the
conviction,  It was argued that the third clause Of  s.	 300Indian	Penal Codedid not apply as it was not	proved	that
the accused intended to inflict a

bodily	injury	that was sufficient to cause  death  in	 the
ordinary course of nature ass. 300Indian Penal Code  third
clause states, "" If it is done with the intention of causing

Effect of belated F.I.R. when fatal.



HEADNOTE:
In  Cr.	  A.  No. 263 of 1971, accused Nos.  6	to  10	were
acquitted by the trial Court but the High Court reversed the
order  of acquittal and convicted them underS. 302/149and148of I.P.C. In Cr.  A. No. 300 of 1971, accused Nos.	1 to
5 were convicted underS. 302/148I.P.C. by both the  Courts
below.
The alleged occurrence giving rise to the prosecution of the
appellants  took place on the night between December 13	 and
14  at	about  2 a.m. as a  result  of	political  animosity
between	  two	groups	of  people-the	Marxists   and	 the
agriculturists	called the ""Karshak Sangham"", in  Puthupally
village in Kottayam, Kerala.  The eyewitnesses, for fear  of
retaliation,  did not report the crime to the police.	Only
on  the next day, a member of the local panchayat (P.W.	 2),
lodged the F.I.R. at 8 A.M. at Kottayam East Police Station,
9 K.M. away from the place of occurrence.
Before	this  Court,  the following points  were  raised  on
behalf	of the appellants :-(i) that the  first	 information
report	is  highly belated and (ii) that  the  alleged	eye-
witnesses  did not lodge the complaint because they  had  in
fact not witnessed the occurrence, and the accused have been
falsely implicated.  Partly allowing the appeal,
HELD  :	 (i) The First Information Report  relating  to	 the
commission of an offence is not a condition precedent to the
setting in motion of a criminal investigation. [23 C]
R. V. Khwaja, I.L.R. [1945] Lah. 1, referred to.

can  only  be made by on eye-witness.  F.I.R.  is  not	even

HEADNOTE:
    The prosecution alleged that there was a dispute between
the appellant in Appeal No. 287 of 1978 and the deceased  in
regard	to payment of repair charges for a machine part	 and
that  three  or	 four days later  this	appellant  alongwith
others attacked the deceased when he was accompanied by P.W.
1  and P.W. 2. It was further alleged that while the  appel-
lant in Appeal No. 288 of 1978 caught hold of the  deceased,
the appellant in the first appeal and two others  repeatedly
stabbed him with knives and caused several injuries. P.W.  2
was  also injured when he tried to intercede.  The  deceased
and  P.W.  2 were taken to hospital where the  deceased	 was
pronounced dead. P.W. 1 presented a complaint at the  Police
Station.
    The appellant in the first appeal absconded and  surren-
dered  before the court later. On questioning, he named	 the
assailants,  who  were	arrested on  different	dates.	Test
indentification	 parades were held for two  accused  persons
wherein the appellant in the second appeal was identified by
three  witnesses,  but the other accused was  identified  by
only  of them. In the subsequent identification parade	held
for  another  accused,	none of the witnesses  was  able  to

ACT:
Criminal  trial--High  Court interfering with  acquittal  by
trial court--When Supreme Court can interfere with  decision
of High Court.Evidence Act(1 of 1872) s. 11, Scope of.
Supreme	   Court   (Enlargement	  of   Criminal	   Appellate
Jurisdiction) Act, 1970--Acquittal set aside and sentence of
life  imprisonment  imposed--Certificate of High  Court	 for
appealing to Supreme Court not necessary.



HEADNOTE:
The  appellant was charged with two offences, (i)  under  s.
307I.P.C.  with respect to one person, and (ii)  under  s.
302/34,I.P.C. for having, along with other accused,  caused
the  death of another.	The trial court convicted him  unders.324I.P.C. on the first charge and acquitted him  of	 the
other charge.  The appeal by the State against the acquittal
on  the second charge was allowed by the High Court and	 the
appellant was convicted unders.302/34I.P.C. and  sentenced
to life imprisonment.
Allowing the appeal to this Court,
HELD : (1) In the case of an appeal against an acquittal the
appellate  court  should not interfere	with  the  acquittal
merely	because	 it  can  take one  of	the  two  reasonably
possible views which favours conviction.  But if the view of
the  trial  court  is not  reasonably  sustainable,  on	 the
evidence on record. the appellate court will interfere	with
the  acquittal.	 If the High Court sets aside  an  acquittal
and  convicts,	this  Court  has  to  be  satisfied,   after
examining the prosecution and defence cases, and the crucial
points	emerging for decision from the facts  of--the  case,
that  the view taken by the trial court, on the evidence  on
record,	 is  atleast as acceptable as the one taken  by	 the
High..."

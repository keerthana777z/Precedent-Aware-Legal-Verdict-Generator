aged  five  years.  The	 entire	 evidence  against  him	 was
circumstantial:	 (a) the accused and the deceased were	last
seen  together; (b) false explanation given by	the  accused
regarding  the	whereabouts  of the  deceased;	(c)  alleged
recovery of the dead body of the deceased at the instance of
the accused and (d) presence of abrasions on the genital  of
the accused as well as blood stains on his wearing  apparels
and  nail clippings. Relying on the circumstantial  evidence
the Trial Court convicted him underSections 302and376and
sentenced  him to death for the offence of murder and  seven
years  rigorous	 imprisonment for the offence of  rape.	 The
High Court confirmed the conviction and the sentence awarded
by the Trial Court. In appeal to this court it was contended
on behalf of the appellant that the circumstantial  evidence
is  wholly  insufficient  to bring home	 the  guilt  of	 the
accused.
     Allowing the appeal, this Court,
     HELD:  1.	The  circumstantial  evidence  in  order  to
sustain	 the conviction must satisfy three  conditions;	 (1)
the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought
to  be drawn, must be cogently and firm..."

HEADNOTE:
     The prosecution alleged that when the deceased girl did
not return  home for  quite some  time from play her mother,
alongwith two  neighbouring women  went in  search  of	her.
Believing that	she might  be in the appellant's house. they

scene. P.W.  5 climbed	over the  roof of his house, entered
the appellant's house through the open court-yard and opened
the front  door. On  entering the  house, according  to	 the
prosecution, the  three ladies	saw the appellant lying on a
cot in	the court-yard with a cover pulled upto his face and

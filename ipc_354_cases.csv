HEADNOTE:
     (Per majority-Krishna Iyer and Desai, JJ.)
^
     1. The only question before the Court is as to when and
why shall capital punishment be pronounced on a murderer and
why not	 in other  cases, within  the confines	of the Code.
Urgency to  the solution  is obvious.  The overt ambivalence
and covert conflict among judges concerning continued resort
to  the	  death	 sentence   mirrors  the  uncertainties	 and
conflicts of values in the community itself. [89G & 90D]
2.Section  302of  the IPC  throws little light on when the
court shall  be the sentence of why the lesser penalty shall
be preferred.  Since law  reflects life,  new meanings	must
permeate the  Penal Code.  Deprivation	of  life  under	 our
system is  too fundamental  to be  permitted except  on	 the
gravest ground	and under the strictest scrutiny. [90F: 94C-
D]
     3. To  say that  discretion of  the Judge	passing	 the
sentence unders. 302IPC  is	 guided	 by  well-recognised
principles shifts  the issue  to what those recognised rules
are. The  big margin  of, subjectivism. a preference for old
precedents, theories of modern penology, behavioral emphasis
or social  antecedents,	 judicial  hubris  or  human  rights
perspectives, reverence for outworn social philosophers-this
plurality of  forces plays a part in swining the pendulum of
sentencing justice  erratically.  Until	 Parliament  speaks,
this Court cannot be silent. [95; 97G]

day, the  complainant's party were making merry with alcohol

appellant joined  them. His  unwelcome presence	 resulted in
frayed tempers,	 and beatings  of  the	3rd  appellant.	 The
latter,	 bent	on  reprisal   for  the	  flagellation	 and
humilation, waited  till sundown  and  returned	 armed	with
friends and  weapons. He  ignited the  attack by instigation
and the	 1st and  2nd appellants  fired with their guns as a
result of which 3 members of the complainants' party died on
the spot.  At this situation, PW 14 brought out his licensed
gun from  his house, and thereupon both sides started firing
and a number of persons sustained gun shot injuries on their
person. In  the midst  of this	firing, the lambardar of the
village appeared  on the scene and made an attempt to pacify
both the  sides, but he also received gun shot injuries as a
result of which he died two days later. A fourth person made

^
     HELD: (Per Sarkaria, J.)
     The records  of this  case be  submitted to the Hon'ble
Chief Justice  for C constituting a larger Bench which would
resolve the doubts, difficulties and inconsistencies pointed
out by	Kailasam J.  in his  order, particularly in its last
paragraph.
     (Per Kailasam, J.)
     1. Before	the amendment  ofSection 367(5)of the Code
of  Criminal   Procedure  by  theCriminal  Procedure	Code
(Amendment) Act1955 (Act  26 of  1955) was introduced, the
normal sentence	 for an	 offence of murder was death and the
lesser sentence was the exception. After the introduction of
the amendment  it was  not obligatory for the court to state
the reasons  as to why the sentence of death was not passed.
By the	amendment the  discretion of  the court	 in deciding
whether to  impose a  sentence of  death or imprisonment for
life became  wider. The	 court was  bound  to  exercise	 its
judicial discretion  in awarding  one or  the other  of	 the
sentences. By the introduction ofSection 354(3)of the Code
of Criminal  Procedure 1973,  the  normal  sentence  is	 the
lesser sentence of imprisonment for life and if the sentence
of death  is to	 be awarded, special reasons will have to be
recorded. In  other words,  the	 court,	 before	 imposing  a
sentence of  death, should  be satisfied that the offence is
of such	 a nature  that the  extreme penalty  is called for.
[1203A-C]
     2. In  a number of decisions, this court has reiterated
the position that undersection 354(3)of the 1973 Code, the
court is  required to  state the  reason..."

(for himself and on behalf of Chandrachud, C. I. and A.C. Gupta and N. L. Untwalia, JJ.) (Majority view)
 

1. This reference to the Constitution Bench raises a question in regard to the constitutional validity of death penalty for murder provided in Section 302, Penal Code, and the sentencing procedure embodied in Sub-section (3) ofSection 354of the CrPC, 1973. 


 

2. The reference has arisen in these circumstances : Bachan Singh, appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 273 of 1979, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death underSection 302, Indian Penal Code for the murders of Desa Singh, Durga Bai and Veeran Bai by the Sessions Judge. The High Court confirmed his death sentence and dismissed his appeal.
 

3. Bachan Singh's appeal by special leave, came up for hearing before a Bench of this Court (consisting of Sarkaria and Kailasam, JJ.). The only question for consideration in the appeal was, whether the facts found by the courts below would be ""special reasons"" for awarding, the death sentence as required underSection 354(3)of the CrPC, 1973.
 

4. Shri H. K. Puri, appearing as amicus curiae on behalf of the appellant, Bachan Singh, in Criminal Appeal No. 273 of 1979, contended that in view of the ratio of Rajendra Prasad v. State of U. P. (1979) 3 SCR 646, the courts below were not competent to impose the extreme penalty of death on the appellant It was submitted that neither the circumstance that the appellant was previously convicted for murder and committed these murders after he had served out the life sentence in the earlier case, nor the fact that these three murders were extremely heinous and inhuman, constitutes a ""special reason"" for imposing the death sentence within the meaning ofSection 354(3)of the CrPC, 1974. Reliance for this argument was placed on Rajendra Prasad (ibid) which, according to the counsel, was on facts very similar, if not identical, to that case.
 

5. Kailasam, J. was of opinion that the majority view in Rajendra Pra..."

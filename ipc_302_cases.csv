Omission  to  frame alternative charge	against	 the  other-

1860), ss. 34,149,302.



HEADNOTE:
The  appellant	and  his brother were put up  for  trial  on
charges	 unders. 302read withs. 34of the  Indian  Penal
Code.  The appellant was specifically charged with murder in
prosecution of the common intention.  There was evidence  to
show that he and not his brother had struck the fatal  blow.
The  brother was acquitted and the appellant  was  convicted
unders. 302and sentenced to transportation for life.	 The
High Court upheld the conviction and sentence and  dismissed
the appeal.  The question was whether the omission to  frame
an  alternative	 charge	 unders.  302simpliciter  was  an
illegality  that  vitiated  the trial  and  invalidated	 the
conviction and whether there was a conflict of decisions  of
this Court on the matter in controversy.
Held  per curiam, that the omission to frame an	 alternative
charge	unders. 302in the facts and circumstances  of	 the
case was not an illegality that vitiated the trial but was a
curable irregularity as it had not occasioned any  prejudice
to the appellant and the conviction was not liable to be set
aside.
That  s.  34  of theIndian Penal Codeby  itself  does	 not
create any offence and where, as in the present case, it  is
possible  to ascertain who struck the fatal blow,  the	fact
that  another  was also sought to be made  liable  does	 not

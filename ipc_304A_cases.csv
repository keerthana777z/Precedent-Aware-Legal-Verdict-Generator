ACT:Indian	Penal	Code-Section  304A-Ingredients	 of-Loss  of
control over  the speeding  truck causing  the fatal  injury
falls unders. 304A.



HEADNOTE:
     On August	23, 1969,  the respondent  accused came in a
tractor and  stopped it	 on the	 highway. Seeing  the parked
truck GTF 904 which he used to drive previously, the accused
used the  key of  his tractor to start the same and drove it
with the  head lights on in full speed. The conductor of the
truck owner  was also  in the  tractor	at  that  time.	 The
tractor while  being driven  by the  field and	while he was
trying to  turn towards	 the kutcha road hit against the cot
in which  the village  Sarpanch who  was resting  on it	 and
taking with  three policemen.  The policemen jumped from the
cot and	 sustained injuries,  while  the  Sarpanch  who	 was
thrown away  by the  impact of	the tractor to a distance of
about ten  feet from the cot, had grievous injuries to which
he succumbed  later. Since  there  was	enmity	between	 the
deceased and  the accused  over the Panchayat elections, the
prosecution put	 up a case of deliberate and willful driving
of the vehicle towards the cot with the intention of causing
death of the deceased Sarpanch. The Sessions Judge convicted
the accused (i) unders. 304Part IT,I.P.C. for causing the
death of  the Sarpanch and (ii) unders. 326and323, I.P.C.
for causing  injuries to the two other persons and sentenced
him for	 rigorous imprisonment for seven years and two years
respectively for  the said  offences. On  appeal to the High
Court the  conviction was  altered to one unders. 304Aonly
and the	 respondent was	 sentenced to  rigorous imprisonment
for 18 months and to a fine of Rs. 500/-.
     Dismissing the  State's appeal  by special	 leave,	 the
